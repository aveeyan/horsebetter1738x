This is the first time I have ever created something using Java. So, there are some issues with the program, such as:

#1 Wrong Horses winning the races in race occasions<br/>
#2 Database needed to be linked separately (because I used the one from my localhost)<br/>
#3 RESET_BET button resets the bet and wages to the default value instead of updated ones.<br/>
<br/>
And so on...
