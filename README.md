This is the first time I have ever worked with Java. So, there are some issues with the program, such as:

#1 Wrong Horses winning the races in race occasions
#2 Database needed to be linked separately (because I used the one from my localhost)
#3 RESET_BET button resets the bet and wages to the default value instead of updated ones.

And so on...
